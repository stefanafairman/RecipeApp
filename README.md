## Status
Project is: _in progress_ 
Updates and maintenance will continue to be made to the website.

## Inspiration
Project inspired by Colt Steele, Udemy Instructor. After taking the course titled: The Web Developer Bootcamp and working on a similar production application called YelpCamp, I wanted to re-design it and make it more personal by building a simple recipe website.

Extra features such as notifications, followers, user profile, and password reset were inspired by Ian Schoonover and his YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/13rOzProductions/videos
